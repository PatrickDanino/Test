1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Come out to the coast.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,533
We'll get together.

3
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:03,944
Have a few laughs.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,150
Mr. McClane.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,490
My friends call me John.

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,460
Yeah, we got it.

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,320
What are you gonna do?

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,570
Improvise!

9
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,670
It's something, huh?

10
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,300
We didn't know whether to
burn it or put it in a museum.

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,170
I'm sure that he said the same thing about me.

12
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,003
You coming?

13
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,173
I'm having fun.

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,903
I'm awake.

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,263
In five years,

16
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:33,530
you have never apologized to me this quickly.

17
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,420
Something's going on here.

18
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm gonna find out what it is.

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,540
I don't wanna talk about time travel,

20
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,730
'cause if we start talking about it,

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,500
then we're gonna be here
all day talking about it

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,753
making diagrams with straws.

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,192
Who's chopper is this?

24
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,133
It's Zed's.

25
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:47,966
Who's Zed?

26
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,900
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

27
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,900
Look. Have any of you heard
of the Army of the 12 Monkeys?

28
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:58,880
Why did you leave me?

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,483
I didn't leave you.

30
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,590
What?

31
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,490
I better make the hole a little bigger.

32
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,940
Anybody else wanna negotiate?

33
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,190
Until help arrives,

34
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,870
I'm deputizing the little
guy, the skinny one,

35
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,040
and the boy with a patch on his eye

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,801
to come with me in the station wagon.

37
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,070
Oh no! Put me back in!

38
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,580
Put me back in please!

39
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,370
Every red-blooded American knows

40
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,690
that the only condiment you are ever

41
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,150
supposed to put on a hamburger is ketchup!

42
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,350
You got a great attitude, Bob.

43
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,480
Real credit to the force, you are.
