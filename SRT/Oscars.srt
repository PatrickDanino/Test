1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,316
(gentle music)

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,700
- Come on Phil, what is it?

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,353
There is something there, right?

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,650
- Not if you can't see it, there ain't.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,018
- I was a great one for the
pictures when I was your age.

6
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,759
I used to think you could
climb right inside the screen.

7
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:26,760
- I wonder why it was stars she gave us?

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,393
Why not diamonds, why not art?

9
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:37,425
Yo no soy Americana.
Yo soy Puertorriqueña.

10
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,860
- It's Auden. Chill of the crooked wing

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,333
falls down along my body.

12
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,807
That's just something I
taught them in the crisis.

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,160
- I'm here, I've been here

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,070
dreaming and believing just like you,

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,190
you just don't wanna see me.

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,070
- When you're at school you do tenses.

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,243
Well here there is only one tense.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,270
There is no future,

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,590
past and the present are the same thing.

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,423
- Arturo.

21
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:10,192
(speaking in in a foreign language)

22
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,020
- I'm not telling these people
that I check the wrong bax.

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,286
If I'm gonna die.

24
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,119
- You're not.

25
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,375
- I would rather die standing up.

26
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,833
- And how sad is that?

27
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,833
That we as Christians who
are supposed to love everyone

28
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,007
are afraid so badly of an AIDS patient.

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,863
- Children are a crushing responsibility.

30
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,555
Happy birthday.

31
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:44,222
(gentle music)
